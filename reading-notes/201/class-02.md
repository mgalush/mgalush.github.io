# JavaScript Basics

A **script** is a series of instructions for a computer, with each individual step known as a **statement**.

Data can be stored in variables.  In order to use a variable, you must *declare* the variable by using the keywords `let` or `var` and then assign a value to the variable:

    let dog = poodle;

Data comes in multiple forms:
- **Numerical**: numbers
- **String**: letters or characters
- **Boolean**: true or false

JavaScript variables are writen in *camelCase*, meaning every word after the first word should start with a capital letter


## Arrays

An **array** is a JavaScript variable that stores a list of variables

    let dog = [poodle, lab, golden retriever];

## Expressions

Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value

    area = 3 * 2;
    greeting = 'Hi ' + 'Molly!';
