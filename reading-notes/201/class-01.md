# HTML & CSS

## HTML Structure
```
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
    the page. And if the page is a long one it might
    be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
    you follow the structure of what is being written. There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings).</p>
    <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p> </body>
</html>
```
