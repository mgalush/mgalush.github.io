# Gender gap

In 2014, only 10% of the tech workforce in top tech companies in Silicon Valley were female, but it hasn't always been that way.  In 1984, 37% of computer sciences graduates were women, but by 2016, that number had dropped to 18%.  Companies state the pipeline is the problem, with poor enrollment and graduate rates among women in tech. Potential causes of this include marketing, early exposure to technology, or the male-dominated culture. 

# Diversity 

Multiple studies show that diverse teams are smarter and more creative, perform better, attract better talent, and are more likely to serve a diverse user base.
