# Responsive Web Design
RWD is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop

It can be broken down into three components: 
* Flexible layouts
* Media queries 
* Flexible media

In a mobile-first approach, you design your application for smaller devices first and then use media querries as the viewport grows.

# CSS Float

Float is a CSS position that "floats" the element to the right or left of the parent element

Their most common use is for wrapping text around images

To clear a float, use the `clear` property.  This will move the element.  Clear can be set to `both`, `left`, or `right`, or to `none` or `inherit`
