# What google learned from it’s quest to build the perfect team

In 2007, Google created project Aristotle which studied hundreds of teams to determine why some teams perform better than others.  They looked at questions such as: 
- how often they socialized outside of work
- if they shared the same hobbies
- if they had similar educational backgrounds
- If they were outgoing or shy

They found no differences based on “who” the individuals were

> "Some groups that were ranked among Google’s most effective teams, for instance, were composed of friends who socialized outside work. Others were made up of people who were basically strangers away from the conference room. Some groups sought strong managers. Others preferred a less hierarchical structure. Most confounding of all, two teams might have nearly identical makeups, with overlapping memberships, but radically different levels of effectiveness. "At Google, we’re good at finding patterns," Dubey said. "There weren’t strong patterns here."

They conducted a research study which concluded that the teams shared two things in common:

1.  Each team member talked in equal proportions, regardless of status or intelligence.  As long as everyone on the team spoke, the team did well, but if even one person didn’t speak, the “collective intelligence” of the team declined

2. The teams had high levels of “social sensitivity”, meaning each team member is attuned to how others feel based off the tone of their voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues

These are aspects of a term called psychological safety, which is shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.  It is a a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up.
