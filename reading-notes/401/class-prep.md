# Problem Solving

Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems:

Try a solution.
If that doesn’t work, try another one.
If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

Sometimes you luck out, but that is the worst way to solve problems and is a huge waste of time.

The best way to solve a problem involves:
* Understanding - you know you understand the problem when you can explain it in plain english 
* Planning - don't start solving the problem until you have a step by step plan on how you're going to solve it
* Dividing - don't try to solve one big problem!  break the problem into sub-problems and solve one by one starting with the simplest 

Note: don't google solutions for big problems, only research solutions for sub-problems

Steps to solve programming problems:
1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

*~70% of your time should be spent in steps 1-3*

# The 5 why's and how's


The *five whys and five hows* technique is a process designed to drill down into the details of a problem or solution.

## "By repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear."
