# HTML Images
`<img>`

Three rules to creating images for a website:

2. Save images at the right size
3. Use the correct resolution

# HTML Colors

You can specify color in HTML in three ways:
1. RGB Values: `rgb(100, 50, 0)`
2. Hex codes: `#384773`
3. Color names: `blue`

You can also alter the colors by changing the:

- `saturation`: amount of gray in a color
- `lightness`: amount of white or black in a color
- `opacity` or `alpha`: amount of transparency in an image

# HTML Text

Three types of typefaces: 
- Serif
- Sans Serif
- Monospace

You can declare a typeface using the `font-family` keyword

Examples of other types of changes you can make to text include: `font-size`, `text-alight`, `letter-spacing`, `line-height`, `text-decoration`, and more

You can also style links using pseudoclasses such as `:visited`, `:hover`, and `:active`
